Music composition chord harmony tool


The app provides harmonic possibilities between two chords, that can be chosen by note and form at the left and right wheels.
The suggested chords can be used to enrich existing chord transitions, thus providing unlimited options for all chord combinations. 
Great for advanced music composition. Chords that appear below the wheels can be clicked and they show diagrams for guitar and piano.
